"""What this API process is doing that a scheduled VM reboot would break.

The VM reboots itself every reboot_interval minutes. Before it does,
scripts/reboot_guard.py asks every API on the VM through GET /busy and holds
the reboot while any of them is busy:

- a backtest of this terminal is queued or running;
- a request that changes something is in flight: an order, a position
  change such as a new stop loss, a deployment, a file write, a compile, a
  terminal restart. Reads (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) never hold a reboot.

Once every API is idle the guard creates the drain flag and checks once
more. While the flag is fresh, new writes are refused with 503
REBOOT_PENDING, so none can start in the seconds between that last check and
the reboot. A stale flag (a guard that died, or one left over from before a
boot) is ignored.
